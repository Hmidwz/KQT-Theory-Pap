# KQT-Theory-Pap
A bilingual research paper introducing the KQT theory: a novel approach to derive the cosmological constant (Λ) from vacuum entropy using quantum genesis operators. Includes experimental design, BEC detectors, and quantum computing applications.
Experimental derivation of the cosmological constant (Λ) from quantum vacuum entropy via a new operator QGO. Includes simulated QVFD detector specs and SAT algorithm results.
